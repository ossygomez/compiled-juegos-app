# compiled-juegos-app

This is a full stack app designed to use Baserow.io as datastore, to display a grid of slot machine games on [Apostala Argentina](https://apostala.com.ar). This application can be seen fully in action on [Tragamonedas gratis - Apostala](https://apostala.com.ar/tragamonedas-gratis/).

Styles are minimally implemented in this project. Just enough to see the elements structure on screen. Images paths and link destinations are relative to the final app deployment. Thus they are incomplete on this project's context.
